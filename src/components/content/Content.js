      <p>
        My name is Seekaplayer and I’m a gamer, streamer and content creator. I
        love gaming and enjoy it. I spend a lot of time doing the things that I
        love to do and I strive to achieve my goals. I started gaming when I was
        a kid and I still am just as passionate about it today as I was back
        then. I’m a PC and Console Gamer and believe that no matter what kind of
        gaming you do as long as you’re having fun that’s all that matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Seekaplayer, I’m 32 years old and I’ve been gaming since I
        was a kid and I don’t plan on stopping anytime soon. I have a passion
        for web design/development, gaming, technology, music and health and
        fitness. I have strive to be the best I can be and I’m always learning
        something new.

        Gaming has always been a big part of my life and I’ve been doing it
        since I can remember. I find gaming to be fun and relaxing (OK the’re
        sometimes where it can get pretty stressful) and I love doing it. I
        mostly game on the PC but do enjoy loading up the XBOX ONE.

      <h2>Web Design/Development</h2>

      <p>
        I’ve always enjoyed web design. I remember my first website was built
        with Microsoft Publisher and then I used some drag and drop programs to
        build other sites. A few years later a friend of mine taught me how to
        code and from there I got inspired to pursue my Bachelors of Science in
        Communications Technology.

      <p>
        Since 2018 health & fitness has had a huge impact on my life. I have had
        a massive transformation and I have changed my life for better. I have
        lost well over 100 pounds and continue to keep myself in shape. I
        workout 3 days a week and keep active when I’m not gaming.

      <p>
        Music has been a big part of my life. I started by learning the
        Saxophone in middle school and was able to pick up almost any instrument
        and have a knack to play it. I play mostly guitar but I do enjoy piano
        and I have attempted to learn the drums but with not much luck.
