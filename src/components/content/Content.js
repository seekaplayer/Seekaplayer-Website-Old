        My name is Seekaplayer and I’m a gamer, streamer and content creator. I
        love gaming and enjoy it. I spend a lot of time doing the things that I
        love to do and I strive to achieve my goals. I started gaming when I was
        a kid and I still am just as passionate about it today as I was back
        then. I’m a PC and Console Gamer and believe that no matter what kind of
        gaming you do as long as you’re having fun that’s all that matters.
